# Developer Portfolio

## Description

This repository hosts my personal developer portfolio, a dynamic and interactive web application designed to showcase my technical skills, significant projects, and professional experience. Built with modern web technologies, this portfolio serves as a comprehensive overview of my capabilities as a developer, highlighting my journey and contributions in the field. It's crafted to provide an engaging user experience, allowing visitors to easily navigate through various sections such as my 'About' section, 'Skills', 'Projects', 'Experience', 'Achievements', and a 'Contact' form. The design prioritizes responsiveness and performance, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

## Installation

To set up and run this project on your local machine, please follow these detailed instructions. This guide assumes you have `git` and `pnpm` (a fast, disk space efficient package manager) installed on your system. If not, please install them first.

### Prerequisites

*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
    *   [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
*   **pnpm**: As the package manager for installing dependencies.
    *   [Install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    Begin by cloning the project from its GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/developer-portfolio.git
    ```

    Replace `https://github.com/your-username/developer-portfolio.git` with the actual URL of your repository.

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    Once cloned, change your current directory to the newly created project folder:

    ```bash
    cd developer-portfolio
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    Install all the necessary project dependencies using pnpm. This command will read the `package.json` file and install all listed packages.

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

    This may take a few moments depending on your internet connection.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the development server and access the portfolio locally:

1.  **Start the development server:**

    Execute the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the Next.js development server, typically on port `3000`.

2.  **Open in your browser:**

    Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

    You should now see the developer portfolio loaded in your browser.

    The application supports hot-reloading, meaning any changes you make to the source code will automatically reflect in the browser without needing to restart the server.
